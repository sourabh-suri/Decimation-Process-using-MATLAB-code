# Decimation-Process-using-MATLAB-code  
  A PROGRAM TO IMPLEMENT THE DECIMATION PROCESS  
  OUTPUT  

Let us take a sinusoidal sequence which has to be decimated:   
Enter the signal frequency fm: 2  
Enetr the sampling frequnecyfs: 100  
Enter the duration of the signal in seconds T: 1  
Enter the factor by which the sampling frequency has to be reduced r: 2
